# Interactive Photo Gallery

#### With this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. After writing the HTML, I wrote my CSS styles in Sass to make the site responsive and mobile friendly with a media query `mixin`. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. Image slideshow was created using a jQuery plugin, Lightbox by Lokesh Dhakar. The search area has a filter feature made possible by JavaScript. Photos will show and hide depending on user input.
